# this is the robot class
# 
# our robot lives in x-y space, and its motion is
# pointed in a random direction. It moves on a straight line
# until is comes close to a wall at which point it turns
# away from the wall and continues to move.
#
# For measurements, it simply senses the x- and y-distance
# to landmarks. This is different from range and bearing as 
# commonly studies in the literature, but this makes it much
# easier to implement the essentials of SLAM without
# cluttered math
#
